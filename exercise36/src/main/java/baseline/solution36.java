 *  Write a program that prompts for response times from a website in milliseconds.
 *  It should keep asking for values until the user enters “done.”
 * The program should print the average time (mean), the minimum time, the maximum time,
 * and the population standard deviation.
 * Create functions called average, max, min, and std, which take in a list of numbers and return the results.
 * Use loops and arrays to perform the input and mathematical operations.
 * Be sure to exclude the "done" entry from the inputs.
 * Be sure to properly ignore any invalid inputs.
 * Keep the input separate from the processing and the output.
