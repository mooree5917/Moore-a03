    Write a program that will help you determine how many months it will take to pay off a credit card balance.
    The program should ask the user to enter the balance of a credit card,
    the APR of the card, and their monthly payment.The program should then return
    the number of months needed (rounded up to the next integer value).
    Formula: n = -(1/30) * log(1 + b/p * (1 - (1 + i)^30)) / log(1 + i)
