 *  Copyright 2021 Eric Moore
 * Create a program that prompts for a list of numbers, separated by spaces.
 * Have the program print out a new list containing only the even numbers.
 * Convert the input to an array. Many languages can easily convert strings to arrays with a built-in function
 * that splits apart a string based on a specified delimiter.
 * Write your own algorithm—don’t rely on the language’s built-in filter or similar enumeration feature.
 * Use a function called filterEvenNumbers to encapsulate the logic for this.
 * The function takes in the original array and returns the new array.
